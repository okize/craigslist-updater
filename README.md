# craigslist-updater

PHP app that sends a text message/email when a saved Craigslist search is updated

I "deployed" this "app" years ago on a Servergrove VPS and used it to buy my car.

(category prop in craigslist_settings.json: cto = cars & trucks by owner; ctd = cars & trucks by dealer'; cta = cars & trucks)
